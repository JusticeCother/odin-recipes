    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>8 (5-inch) corn tortillas</li>
        <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons taco seasoning</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil, or as needed for frying</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced white onion</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>lime wedges, for serving</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salsa, or as needed, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay 8 tortillas flat on a surface. </li>
        <li>Combine beef, taco seasoning, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. </li>
        <li>Press 1/4 cup of beef mixture onto half of each tortilla. </li>
        <li>Heat 1/4-inch of oil in a high-sided skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches, carefully add one taco at a time, flat, to the hot oil. </li>
        <li>Hold empty side of the tortilla with a pair of tongs, and fold over beef filling once the shell is softened, about 5 seconds. </li>
        <li>Cook, turning once, until shell is golden brown and beef is no longer pink in the center, 30 seconds to 1 minute per side.. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).  </li>
        <li>Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.  </li>
        <li>Serve immediately topped with onion and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges, salsa, and hot sauce. </li>
    </ol>
